Born in a binary state, each ‘Bubble’ is ‘inflated’ at mint, and designated a resiliency parameter. If the collector reaches the resiliency threshold, through trading before the parameter is met, the Bubble will explode! After that, the Bubble becomes ‘immortalized,’ irreversibly. Each token’s smart contract records its state (’inflated/immortalized’) on-chain, and displays a corresponding visual expression.

Born out of the most recent bull market, we want to get back to relaxing, being creative, letting our hair down, and having some fun again! Many of us have a hangover from the ultra-manic, speculation-driven madness of 2021-2021. The Dankness is designed to cure that hangover with an offering that is intentionally experimental and designed to show the more human side of the many amazing participants in the NFT community. \n\nWhile some of you may know us, episode zero is designed to give a bit of our background and to introduce ourselves to those of you we haven’t met yet (welcome!). Artnome gives his life story and explains how it all leads up to being an early part of CryptoArt, NFTs, and this podcast! Sickles shares a bit about his background as a documentary film maker and what it has been like to spend the last two years interviewing hundreds of the most talented and interesting people in the NFT community for what will become “the” definitive documentary on this culture. We end the episode by returning to a question Artnome first asked in early 2018… What is CryptoArt?\n\nTo keep up with the podcast follow @thedanknessxyz on Twitter.

Josie is well known for her early genre-defining work as a CryptoArtist including such iconic pieces as her 2018 paintings Filter and Acceptance. Josie is also known to  NFT collectors around the world as the dynamic and innovative CEO and Founder behind the wildly successful CyberBrokers - A first-of-its-kind digital art collectibles ecosystem centered around 10,001 unique and on-chain NFTs. \n\nIn this episode, Josie and Artnome get into a debate about the metaverse (is it cool or does it kinda suck?) and find common ground in their atypical religious upbringings. Josie later opens up sharing a really heartfelt story about one of her community members (our favorite part of this episode). She’s as real as it gets, and that is why we’ve picked her out of 8 billion people in the world to be our first guest! \n\nAs a bonus, the legendary ROBNESS joins us to share a deep cut about the origins of trash art.

Sarah, known by many as “The Sarah Show” is a proud psychonaut, former Jeopardy champion, and exceptionally accomplished artist. Her deeply personal work “merges the gorgeous and grotesque through humor, psychedelia, mysticism, and the interplay of cutting edge and obsolete technologies.”\n\nWhat we love most about Sarah is that her work is equally at home on Giphy (where it has been viewed billions of times) as it is in world renowned art museums. Sarah’s brilliant weirdness and unique vision speaks to us all! \n\nWe cover a lot of territory with Sarah from her participation in “Peer to Peer”, an exhibition at the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, to  to her first psychedelic experience. You may know and love Sarah’s work as an artist but here is your chance to get to know her better as the amazing person she is. Sarah is our favorite “one of one” and we’re thrilled to have her on the show!\n\nBefore we jump into the interview with Sarah, Sickles and Artnome ask what the impact of the FTX collapse will be on the CryptoArt community and NFT market.

Matt is a self taught programmer who came to coding as a way to better actualize his artist visions through his own custom software. His work features dense multi-layered works that bring to mind complex, intricate, mesh-like, webs or networks. Matt is perhaps best known for his tremendously successful 2021 Art Blocks project “Gazers.” With Gazers, the works respond to the cycles of the moon and are perpetually shifting, making these works collectors want to live with and regularly revisit.   \n\nIn this episode, we discuss Matt’s journey from “lurker” to leader in the Cryptoart movement. Matt is candid about early successes and struggles to make it as an artist and the positive opportunities Cryptoart opened up for him. We learn where his interest in currency as a theme in his art stems from and his discovery of crypto. He also shares his love of art history and how analog painters like Monet serve as inspiration for his digital works. Matt shares an important story detailing how he collaborated with other important members of the crypto art community in 2020 to successfully lobby for a minimum secondary resale standard for artists. The Dankness is grateful to Matt for sharing so much of his story, it’s a special and insightful conversation, and we hope you find it as engaging as we did!   \n\nYou should absolutely follow Matt Kane at @MattKaneArtist and you can learn more about his unique and engaging body of work on his website mattkane.com.\n\nTo keep up with the podcast follow @thedanknessxyz on Twitter.

Over the summer, I spent a few months in a small house on the coast, immersed in nature. While I was there, the camera on my phone stopped working properly. The pictures were sometimes overexposed, distorted or out of focus. Intrigued by this optical effect, I started experimenting with the camera, taking pictures of plants and nature.\n\nPhotographing the sunlight became my pleasure and my obsession. The bright light reacted to the broken camera shutter and left traces of interesting textures on the sensor. Most of the time I'd come home not knowing what to expect from the pictures. It's a feeling I remember from developing film in the darkroom, where it's often hard to predict what the end result will be. This happy accident made me think about that feeling. I was fascinated by the unexpected distortions, and a generative series of photographs seemed like the ideal medium to explore that sense of surprise and discovery. A generator of happy accidents.\n\nA digital darkroom, behind the scenes, is operated by a random algorithm that further processes the images, using a vocabulary of visual alterations borrowed from both the digital and analog worlds. When a new piece is minted, the pictures are altered, mixed, and distorted in unpredictable ways. Through this process, the images become more abstract, feeling at once surreal and familiar, universal and specific, very obvious and enigmatic. In a way, the visual qualities of the images evokes the elusive feeling of a distant memory.\n\nThe project will also include an accompanying text for each piece. Artificial intelligence has generated hundreds of imaginary travelogues with the prompt of describing a day spent on the coast. These fragments are drawn from our collective memory, which, like the images, are traces of something experienced by all of us and by no one in particular. These travelogues may look real, but when you look closer there's something off about them. It's interesting to explore that sense of ambiguity. The fictional story is part of the token and when visited in live view, the text is revealed by clicking on the image.\n\nThe work is presented in the format of a standard 35mm camera print (4×6 inches) with a date stamp on it that closely resembles the one impressed on vacation photos by cheap snapshot cameras. The date, in this case, is tied with the time in which the photo is minted, like a souvenir of the day when the memory was captured on the Ethereum blockchain.","dt":"2023-08-29","ts":1693292400,"i":329,"n_txs":6,"g1":-0.0227,"g2":0.0459,"g3":-0.0205,"uniq_owners":4,"connection":0.2448},{"chainid":"1","name":"Diego Rodriguez","symbol":"dhtenshi","address":"0x22adcaf1d6b5213a76bfddab6d4d38c25ce7c029","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/6JDVZ3fw1GQaIaavbrgaTkwwUaBplEKvvs792wDIimD-Wo-CESDIa1DciRZrMLhfilougoHFSmBYfziWlonSVZ0?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Art NFTs by Diego Rodriguez.

After two frenetic years she needed to take a step back and focus on developing her technique and art practice. ESCAPE is the product of this pace change, its icon, and a map guiding us towards this same freedom.\n\nFor Velitchkova the relationship between artist and machine is deeply collaborative, nurturing unexpected elements that emerge from the code. This algorithm began in systems that balance order and chaos. First a distinctive style reminiscent of architectural maps emerged. From this grew the brutalism characteristic of former Soviet cityscapes of the artist’s early childhood in Bulgaria. Ultimately stifled by this rigidity and repetition, Velitchkova pushed the algorithm further—breaking it and in the result discovering the form of an opera house, a structure that had become a symbol of freedom to the artist, the promise of losing oneself in art.\n\nThe overwhelming superstructure of architectural lines breaks the picture plane and seems to go beyond three dimensionality. By avoiding easy categorization, the viewer spends time considering the forms and making sense of the composition. It becomes possible to escape everyday concerns for a moment longer, lost in the almost mathematical task of viewing these geometries. The opera house icon emerges as an antidote to these illusive structures. This central figure is suddenly recognizable as a flat or three dimensional shape. Whether in dense black or highlighted as a central white figure, it is a condensation point, a place for our mind to rest. The images combine the icons of this escape but also serve as a visual guide to achieving it.\n\nWe are reminded of what art can offer us—mental freedom. Yet ultimately this is an illusion. Just as the opera is a staged fiction with its own rules and schedule, this composition is not real; it is a staged performance specifically created to evoke this reaction.","dt":"2023-05-16","ts":1684220400,"i":374,"n_txs":18,"g1":-0.01,"g2":0.0256,"g3":-0.0177,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.2181},{"chainid":"1","name":"Estate","symbol":"EST","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/5KIxEGmnAiL5psnMCSLPlfSxDxfRSk4sTQRSyhPdgnu70nGb2YsuVxTmO2iKEkOZOfq476Bl1hAu6aJIKjs1myY?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Decentraland is an Ethereum blockchain-powered virtual world, developed and owned by its users, who can create, experience, and monetize content and applications.

Through a Homestead-like network, a miner bought off ebay is retired forever – and morphs into the commemorative coin.

The street leads to a small open pit where they extract iron. Images from 1956 and 1965 show how the road becomes shorter, and houses once surrounded by fields are now on the pit's edge. Some of them disappeared to facilitate access to the ore. The mine grew, consuming mountains, meadows, and settlements.\n\nGallarta disappeared in 1977, replaced by a chasm extending across the area until today. The open pit extraction in the mine stopped being profitable only six years later. The scar it left on the surface of the mountainous area is a monument to the disappearance of this and numerous other towns with similar stories.","dt":"2023-03-29","ts":1680073200,"i":687,"n_txs":8,"g1":-0.0197,"g2":0.0502,"g3":-0.0183,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.2159},{"chainid":"1","name":"Mint Pass Hanabi | Ykxotkx x Suntory x Bright Moments | MPHN","symbol":"MPHN","address":"0x4899b8a2a70f4aa75decca77c619562c7a6e8762","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/18b5f02b84b8958da1840e1deae94235.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"","dt":"2023-05-02","ts":1683010800,"i":688,"n_txs":5,"g1":-0.0204,"g2":0.0494,"g3":-0.012,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.2129},{"chainid":"1","name":"Mint Pass Mexico City | MPMX","symbol":"MPMX","address":"0x51992c5cd2e8a282d5fd21731af6bfaa0c0b1e57","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/b1b68621595163ebc3ef0db8cc36afc9.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Mint Pass Mexico City provides a claim to attend NFT Art CDMX and mint a generative artwork from one of the ten artists that are randomly mapped and revealed to each Mint Pass (0-9).

The mining process prevents front-running and network congestion while maintaining security, and parallel mining-difficulty and price-demand-curves create natural, market-driven scarcity.\r\n\r\nPOW NFT atoms are generated according to a scarcity model relative to the natural distribution of elements.

And one of those rules is the court, a highly regulated environment that is essentially a handful of rectangles and lines. Add a ball—a circle, really—and the formula is complete. What we have is not just a record of incredible skill and sportsmanship, but art, as it were, ready-made.\r\n\r\nWherever the ball lands, we mark it. Underneath each ball is a shadow-like ellipse that indicates the direction and speed of each shot. We add color ensuring that each composition reveals at least one line and two fields of color. Then, with data generated by the ATP, we curate 300 of the most impactful moments from the Finals, from the fastest serve to the championship winning shot.","dt":"2022-12-04","ts":1670140800,"i":1041,"n_txs":11,"g1":-0.019,"g2":0.0388,"g3":-0.0125,"uniq_owners":5,"connection":0.3067},{"chainid":"1","name":"Terraflows","symbol":"terraflows","address":"0x1a7b3c302e5c4ba9a282105dde1c64333723a189","img":"https://openseauserdata.com/files/fe2b1ce8a6102c16ff34b9c63ca5b276.svg","desc":"Flow field representation of the Terraforms onchain place (project is homage to Mathcastles)","dt":"2023-02-18","ts":1676707200,"i":1042,"n_txs":61,"g1":-0.0336,"g2":-0.0217,"g3":0.02,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.2317},{"chainid":"1","name":"Terraforms","symbol":"TERRAFORMS","address":"0x4e1f41613c9084fdb9e34e11fae9412427480e56","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/8987b795655076fdf8183a7daee3754a.gif?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Onchain land art from a dynamically generated onchain 3D world.","dt":"2021-12-17","ts":1639728000,"i":1043,"n_txs":191,"g1":-0.076,"g2":-0.0327,"g3":-0.0273,"uniq_owners":21,"connection":0.4584},{"chainid":"1","name":"terrariumClub","symbol":"SHROOM","address":"0xc8d5517fd038206a65263bc25b230f6809ac7e3a","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/993d728acdbe7aefc446fd4fddbfe36b.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"つ◕_◕つ 🍄\n10,000 CC0 generative art compositions of Space Mushrooms with some hidden secrets and magic.\nFor the web3 community, with love.","dt":"2022-06-24","ts":1656054000,"i":1044,"n_txs":28,"g1":-0.0332,"g2":-0.0243,"g3":0.0297,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.2343},{"chainid":"1","name":"TEST FLIGHT CREW","symbol":"TFC","address":"0xfdb760b4de27fd1a3377840bf502ebc0732a5d9d","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/sFsiFjW1zGqKa5iTab8yUPmDToSTig-moeJvLLsDE3tMLjJ2vMZR6ANkEOkPFucGRRffY8uylAaXVAj9WY2iDS6qBUOASOb7cwfm8w?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Links: https://linktr.ee/TSRocketfactory\n\nPatches are a representation of dedication and achievement in the Rocket Factory.

This was recognized in 1968 in two exhibitions curated by Jasia Reichardt at the ICA in London: _Fluorescent Chrysanthemum_ and _Cybernetic Serendipity_, with the latter situating the Japanese Computer Technique Group (CTG) as part of a global community of computer artists.<br><br>In fact, it was a philosopher Hiroshi Kawano (1925-2012) who pioneered computer art in Japan, expressed through his writings on computational aesthetics and early experiments with an OKITAC 5090A computer at the University of Tokyo. _Patterns of Flow_ references one of Kawano’s earliest explorations of graphical calculation, and pays tribute to someone who was, in Reichardt’s words, “ahead in all directions.” Thanks to the NFT as a technology as well as the global profile of the Processing community, a new generation of Japanese creative coders is currently elaborating on the aesthetic universe once imagined by Kawano.<br><br>**_Simulating the Human_**<br><br>Kawano aimed to establish a new aesthetic grounded in information theory and cybernetics. Influenced by the writings of Max Bense (1910-1990) and others, his vision was not for a “computer-aided art” that would expand human creativity, but rather a “creative act where the computer itself thinks freely, much like a human.” 2 To achieve this aim, he devised the so-called “K-System,” comprising an “eye” that receives an input image as a sequence of pixels, a “brain” (generative subsystem) that analyzes and reconfigures it into a new image, and a “hand” that crafts a physical output. He used this system to produce such major works as _Series of Pattern: Flow_ (1964), and _Simulated Color Mosaic_ (1969). In patterning human creativity according to computer calculations — a practice he termed “artistic simulation” — Kawano’s approach challenged the Western conception of art as a rigid domain of the human. 3 At a time when human creativity (and generative art) increasingly involves machine learning, his ideas are more resonant than ever.<br><br>Efforts to connect Kawano’s concepts to the present have been carried forward by a small number of dedicated individuals, while numerous exhibitions have cemented Kawano’s legacy in Japan. These include: _ARTS ON COMPUTER_ at O Art Museum (1987), _20th Century Computer Art: Beginnings and Developments: The work and thought of pioneers and contemporary practitioners of algorithmic art_ at Tama Art University (2006), and _Reinventing Image-Making_ at Tokyo Photographic Art Museum (2022). With the output space of generative art growing increasingly saturated, _Patterns of Flow_ returns to the source of Kawano’s experiments to chart an alternative path.<br><br>**_Patterns of Flow_**<br><br>As the product of a global movement rooted in digital geography, it is hard to identify new generative aesthetics that are unique to Japan. Nevertheless, notable figures have emerged to disrupt the space of generative art. All of the artists participating in this exhibition — including Satoshi Aizawa, Saeko Ehara, Misaki Nakano, mole^3, Okazz, Senbaku, Shunsuke Takawo, Kaoru Tanaka, Kazuhiro Tanimoto, and ykxotkx — have established their own connections with Kawano’s creative imaginary. The result is a series of long-form projects that reflect Japan as an emergent field. Like the experimental workshop, Jikken Kōbō, which united artists, musicians, theater designers, and performers with an interest in new technology — this microcommunity is defined as much by hybridity as its love of code as a creative medium.<br><br>Among the artists, Shunsuke Takawo has played an essential role in engaging the new generation of creative coders with the legacy of Hiroshi Kawano. An advocate of _daily coding_, he has been using the open-source tool p5.js to make generative art since 2019. If the work of artists is the product of a lifetime, then Takawo’s outputs are closer to haikus or tankas that express fleeting emotions or the wonder of nature. Like sketching in oils, daily coding is not preoccupied with perfection so much as improvisation and the creative potential of recursive procedure. When established as a habitual practice, generative art becomes a world in flux, each output a new possibility among many. The artists participating in this show embrace daily coding, using and reusing algorithms in a form of bricolage on the blockchain. They have also adopted the vertical format, which calls to mind Kawano’s _Simulated Color Mosaic_ as well as _kakejiku_ (“hanging scrolls”).<br><br>In Kawano’s 2009 book, _The Emergence of Network Aesthetics_, published just three years before he died, he described a method of independent, flexible, and improvisational creation that was “comprehensive from below” — a process whereby the world reveals itself as a result of autonomous actions by independent agents. Here was a model of human consciousness emerging from dynamic, pluralistic networks, as well as a primitive form of beauty. With daily coding, every day is a unit whose creative output exists on its own terms and as the basic digital material for further creation: the source of larger systems. In a space where consciousness is no longer defined by old white walls, creativity has no conclusion.<br><br>_Patterns of Flow_ is Feral File’s first hybrid exhibition, running online and in physical space at NEORT++ in Tokyo from September 25 – October 6, 2024. The show features works by contemporary artists alongside those of Hiroshi Kawano courtesy of Tama Art University Museum. It is accompanied by a special essay by Jasia Reichardt. The exhibition is made possible thanks to the support of Noriaki Nakata and NEORT++ with research by artist and researcher Hasaqui Yamanobe.<br><br>1\\.
