With many NFT's on the market, you have to trust that whoever is hosting the actual image keeps their promise to host the artwork for the entire life of the ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs an on-chain maximalist, I find the idea of trusting centralized services to host artwork that I own entirely too custodial, and against the overall ethos of crypto and decentralization. What value can an NFT really have, so long as the token itself is not inseparable from the art in question? It is this question that led to the development of ASCIIPunks.\n\nSo if you are an on-chain maximalist, a decentralization junkie, or a real OG crypto head, this is the project for you.","dt":"2021-03-27","ts":1616828400,"i":41,"n_txs":16,"g1":-0.0241,"g2":0.0219,"g3":-0.0413,"uniq_owners":6,"connection":0.3544},{"chainid":"1","name":"Async Art","symbol":"ASYNC-V2","address":"0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/GHuVPCTdGQZvPQc-Q8sSDXkNg_RepaUOZk5J6cU9AKzwfABb2lOkA3pB_5i_CJPDzmzrRchZtZdM5zNrxaN40HY?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Create, collect, and trade programmable art: digital paintings split into \"Layers\" which you can use to affect the overall image.","dt":"2020-02-23","ts":1582444800,"i":42,"n_txs":88,"g1":0.0349,"g2":0.1472,"g3":0.0074,"uniq_owners":16,"connection":0.4118},{"chainid":"1","name":"Async Art","symbol":"ASYNC","address":"0x6c424c25e9f1fff9642cb5b7750b0db7312c29ad","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/GHuVPCTdGQZvPQc-Q8sSDXkNg_RepaUOZk5J6cU9AKzwfABb2lOkA3pB_5i_CJPDzmzrRchZtZdM5zNrxaN40HY?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Create, collect, and trade programmable art: digital paintings split into \"Layers\" which you can use to affect the overall image.","dt":"2020-02-23","ts":1582444800,"i":43,"n_txs":43,"g1":0.011,"g2":0.0433,"g3":-0.0084,"uniq_owners":4,"connection":0.1569},{"chainid":"1","name":"Async Blueprints V2","symbol":"ASYNC-BLUEPRINT-2","address":"0xe428c901568ab6116f4e5ffa11fdafe008e51b6b","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/d6fb878fdeebeff1518276539a2a8356.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Explore limited editions of generative and provably random art collections made with Blueprints on Async Canvas.","dt":"2021-12-13","ts":1639382400,"i":44,"n_txs":88,"g1":0.0089,"g2":0.085,"g3":0.0296,"uniq_owners":8,"connection":0.3395},{"chainid":"1","name":"Async Blueprints","symbol":"ASYNC-BLUEPRINT","address":"0xc143bbfcdbdbed6d454803804752a064a622c1f3","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/d6fb878fdeebeff1518276539a2a8356.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Explore limited editions of generative and provably random art collections made with Blueprints on Async Canvas.","dt":"2021-12-13","ts":1639382400,"i":45,"n_txs":795,"g1":0.0029,"g2":0.2097,"g3":0.0397,"uniq_owners":32,"connection":0.5406},{"chainid":"1","name":"Async Music Blueprints V2","symbol":"ASYNC-MUSIC-2","address":"0xbc402bed62c90afd0e104be32bdee9447b5ccd0d","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/1f5473b198fa08439b0380ace593573f.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Explore limited editions of generative and provably random music collections made with Blueprints on Async Canvas.","dt":"2022-06-28","ts":1656399600,"i":46,"n_txs":29,"g1":0.0068,"g2":0.054,"g3":-0.0128,"uniq_owners":7,"connection":0.3603},{"chainid":"1","name":"Async Music Blueprints","symbol":"ASYNC-MUSIC","address":"0x71925638b9998ab631c83873d9ed19ef9b70ecf0","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/1f5473b198fa08439b0380ace593573f.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Explore limited editions of generative and provably random music collections made with Blueprints on Async Canvas.","dt":"2022-06-28","ts":1656399600,"i":47,"n_txs":21,"g1":0.0036,"g2":0.081,"g3":0.0124,"uniq_owners":7,"connection":0.2812},{"chainid":"1","name":"Audioglyphs","symbol":"AG","address":"0xfb3765e0e7ac73e736566af913fa58c3cfd686b7","img":"https://openseauserdata.com/files/50bedeeed1fb1cac38cb9c5d3ea909cd.svg","desc":"10,000 randomly generated, infinite audio NFTs derived from on-chain [Pixelglyph](https://opensea.io/collection/pixelglyphs) data.\r\n\r\nEach Audioglyph synthesizes a unique, infinite stream of music directly in your browser at lossless quality.\r\n\r\n## Future of Music\r\nAudioglyphs are a glimpse into a future of music where instead of publishing statically recorded songs and limiting access, artists create infinite variations that are available to all to explore freely.\r\n\r\nInstead of buying the rights to listen to music, listeners can truly own a unique version.\r\n\r\n## Open Technology\r\n\r\nWe plan to open source the core technology Audioglyphs uses for managing and embedding audio processing on the web.\r\n\r\nWith the success of Audioglyphs, we plan to continue to develop tools for artists to create and publish generative music.\r\n\r\n## Carbon neutral\r\n\r\nCarbon emissions from minting will be offset with a donation supporting the Devarahipparigi Wind Power Project in Karnataka, India facilitated by Offsetra","dt":"2021-08-16","ts":1629097200,"i":48,"n_txs":84,"g1":-0.0147,"g2":0.0218,"g3":-0.0286,"uniq_owners":10,"connection":0.4304},{"chainid":"1","name":"August Sander 10K collection","symbol":"AS10K","address":"0x7037843d739d846cdce3a6839a80f7d70b60b99a","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/CDOMF6UFLrV6psq2kabz_nkkZVJZi-2pxrrgbuG23nT2iYGpJVNXHfbj0VOV8H-OIDPbKGNG4vzcMCSEgg3_ZeykKroF1ukOk4t7wNs?w=500&auto=format","desc":"AS10k+ represents the catalogue raisonn√© of August Sander, one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century.

Born out of the most recent bull market, we want to get back to relaxing, being creative, letting our hair down, and having some fun again! Many of us have a hangover from the ultra-manic, speculation-driven madness of 2021-2021. The Dankness is designed to cure that hangover with an offering that is intentionally experimental and designed to show the more human side of the many amazing participants in the NFT community. \n\nWhile some of you may know us, episode zero is designed to give a bit of our background and to introduce ourselves to those of you we haven‚Äôt met yet (welcome!). Artnome gives his life story and explains how it all leads up to being an early part of CryptoArt, NFTs, and this podcast! Sickles shares a bit about his background as a documentary film maker and what it has been like to spend the last two years interviewing hundreds of the most talented and interesting people in the NFT community for what will become ‚Äúthe‚Äù definitive documentary on this culture. We end the episode by returning to a question Artnome first asked in early 2018‚Ä¶ What is CryptoArt?\n\nTo keep up with the podcast follow @thedanknessxyz on Twitter.

Josie is also known to  NFT collectors around the world as the dynamic and innovative CEO and Founder behind the wildly successful CyberBrokers - A first-of-its-kind digital art collectibles ecosystem centered around 10,001 unique and on-chain NFTs. \n\nIn this episode, Josie and Artnome get into a debate about the metaverse (is it cool or does it kinda suck?) and find common ground in their atypical religious upbringings. Josie later opens up sharing a really heartfelt story about one of her community members (our favorite part of this episode). She‚Äôs as real as it gets, and that is why we‚Äôve picked her out of 8 billion people in the world to be our first guest! \n\nAs a bonus, the legendary ROBNESS joins us to share a deep cut about the origins of trash art.

Her deeply personal work ‚Äúmerges the gorgeous and grotesque through humor, psychedelia, mysticism, and the interplay of cutting edge and obsolete technologies.‚Äù\n\nWhat we love most about Sarah is that her work is equally at home on Giphy (where it has been viewed billions of times) as it is in world renowned art museums. Sarah‚Äôs brilliant weirdness and unique vision speaks to us all! \n\nWe cover a lot of territory with Sarah from her participation in ‚ÄúPeer to Peer‚Äù, an exhibition at the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, to  to her first psychedelic experience. You may know and love Sarah‚Äôs work as an artist but here is your chance to get to know her better as the amazing person she is. Sarah is our favorite ‚Äúone of one‚Äù and we‚Äôre thrilled to have her on the show!\n\nBefore we jump into the interview with Sarah, Sickles and Artnome ask what the impact of the FTX collapse will be on the CryptoArt community and NFT market.
