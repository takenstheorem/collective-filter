Blockchain and social media add a new angle to the same question: What is the size of an audience that makes an artistic practice sustainable? These numbers are moving as new chains emerge and more art becomes available to bigger audiences. High speed, low cost transactions and onchain art expand the space towards millions of new collectors and more accessible cultural production.   \n\nThe interactive realtime animation creates a garden as metaphor for the beauty of an audience that is decentralized and distributed, but connected by chains and communities. As it grows with each transaction, a complex ecosystem emerges: Smaller than the scale we know from mass media, but bigger than the handful of collectors enabling artistic practice in the context of contemporary art before the internet. Shaped by technology and multiple dynamic value systems, seeded by the first 1,000 True Fans. \n\nBeyond contemplation of networks and shifting modes of patronage, the work was inspired by the way we experience flower gardens as children. These new models are still in their infancy and those of us early enough to experience it all stand like children watching huge flowers bloom and sway around us, pointing to beautiful possibilities ahead.\n","slug":"1000-true-fans","dt":"2023-08-22","ts":1692687600,"i":3,"n_txs":24,"g1":-0.2324,"g2":0.1902,"g3":-0.0027,"uniq_owners":6,"connection":0.8424},{"chainid":"8453","name":"1337 Brians","symbol":"1337BRIAN","address":"0x5519dc53d698ce6b9eefc71efc454e4b269307b9","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/106d89e19a88c8b7bc30a824fc20910f.gif?w=500&auto=format","desc":"1337 Brians is a collection of 8,453 pixel art bald brians, deployed fully onchain with a public domain license.

Designed with accessibility in mind, it operates smoothly on any device or browser supporting WebGL2, ensuring a fluid experience across both mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nEach iteration starts by randomly generating 8 non-overlapping rectangles, each controlled by a unique rule selected from a set of 32, resulting in diverse pixel-shifting behaviors. The duration of each cycle is determined by the largest rectangle, creating continuous and dynamic movement. With each new cycle, 8 newly sized and positioned rectangles are generated with fresh shifting rules.\n\nAn invisible ring of noise values encircles the canvas, driving the animation as rectangles shift pixels into view based on their specific rules. The red, green, and blue channels of the noise influence three aspects:\n> Red: Selection of ASCII characters.\n> Green: Inverting the ASCII character and its background color.\n> Blue: Rotating the ASCII character in 90-degree increments.\n\nASCIISHIFT8 mints feature 8 randomly selected characters from a pool of 64 and an 8-color palette based on each iteration’s unique hue and saturation values. There's also an 8% chance to activate a \"16-bit mode,\" which doubles the character set and applies a 16-color palette inspired by the aesthetics of vintage computing and pixel art.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nThe pixel-shifting mechanics of ASCIISHIFT8 are inspired by the brilliance of Kim Asendorf's 'monogrid 1.1 CE,' which influenced how the interaction of rules, shapes, and generative motion is approached in this project.\n\n[CONTROLS]\n\n{KEYBOARD}\n> [space] - Pause/Play\n> [r] - Reset to initial state\n> [t] - Cycle fps {60, 30, 15}\n> [f] - Toggle fullscreen\n> [g] - Cycle rectangle reset time multiplier {1, 2, 4, 8}\n> [1-9] - Create GIF output with duration in seconds\n> [0] - Create PNG output\n> [arrow up/down] - Cycle font size {8, 16, 32, 64}\n> [x] - Toggle kaleidoscope effect {cycles through 1, 2, 4, 8 mirror lines}\n> [c] - Toggle char color mode {sampled or fixed [light]}\n> [v] - Swap char and cell bg colors\n> [b] - Cycle background color {dark or light}\n> [n] - Cycle color palette {only if 16 bit mode is enabled}\n\n{TOUCH}\n> [double tap] - Cycle font size\n> [long press] - Toggle kaleidoscope effect\n\n> [single tap]\n>>>> [top half]\n>>>>>>> [left third] - Toggle char color mode\n>>>>>>> [middle third] - Swap char and cell bg colors\n>>>>>>> [right third] - Cycle background color\n>>>> [bottom half]\n>>>>>>> [left third] - Pause/Play\n>>>>>>> [middle third] - Reset to initial state\n>>>>>>> [right third] - Cycle fps\n\nCreated using p5.js, p5.asciify and WebGL2.\n\nASCIISHIFT8 © 2024 by humanbydefinition is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","slug":"asciishift8-1","dt":"2024-10-04","ts":1728025200,"i":10,"n_txs":10,"g1":0.0064,"g2":0.004,"g3":0.0247,"uniq_owners":2,"connection":0.2844},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Atari Asteroids | Onchain Arcade","symbol":"ASTEROIDS","address":"0x8453000bab46eaaa842b1a6b695d8fa9ef0b144f","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/540144c39879bb6d24b239df41dce88d.webp?w=500&auto=format","desc":"NFT for the Atari Asteroids game on the Onchain Arcade.","slug":"atari-asteroids-onchain-arcade","dt":"2024-07-21","ts":1721545200,"i":11,"n_txs":8,"g1":-0.0713,"g2":-0.0556,"g3":0.0126,"uniq_owners":4,"connection":0.664},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Atari Breakout | Onchain Arcade","symbol":"BREAKOUT","address":"0x8453000219fd0311912c1605b01b99d4985f3d21","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/4515ca55b36aa26f65d1e15a3d7ccdd5.webp?w=500&auto=format","desc":"","slug":"atari-breakout-onchain-arcade","dt":"2024-07-28","ts":1722150000,"i":12,"n_txs":3,"g1":-0.0317,"g2":-0.0101,"g3":-0.0047,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.7046},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Aux Arbres by zancan","symbol":"OZARBR","address":"0x26a1f8813df5a318ed7aa1091c30db0f25727a18","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/88c66230ddc1e17106ab5232f31d8900.jpg?w=500&auto=format","desc":"*Aux Arbres*\n\"To the Trees\" \n\nInfinite variations around the universal symbol of a tree.\n\nBrowse the trees at https://auxarbres.xyz\n\n- Generative Art\n- Made with original JavaScript code\n- zancan, 2024\n\n","slug":"aux-arbres","dt":"2024-02-20","ts":1708416000,"i":13,"n_txs":126,"g1":-0.1553,"g2":0.0069,"g3":-0.0548,"uniq_owners":5,"connection":1.0291},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Base Colors","symbol":"COLORS","address":"0x7bc1c072742d8391817eb4eb2317f98dc72c61db","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/e17940350dd96101e351496d96eb5d15.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Base Colors is the NFT collection for every color on the internet.","slug":"base-colors-nft","dt":"2024-06-22","ts":1719039600,"i":14,"n_txs":130,"g1":-0.0269,"g2":-0.0889,"g3":0.2114,"uniq_owners":3,"connection":0.5684},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Base Day One","symbol":"$BASEDAYONE","address":"0x7d5861cfe1c74aaa0999b7e2651bf2ebd2a62d89","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/30a1c5cbc4dbbfd9151ba93e294a8f53.gif?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Base Day One commemorates the first day of Base.\r\n\r\nWatch it evolve as more people come onchain and collectively create our story.\r\n\r\nAll proceeds will support the next generation of builders on Base; this does not confer any other rights.\r\n\r\nGET ONCHAIN at onchainsummer.xyz and mint to join us.","slug":"base-day-one","dt":"2023-08-09","ts":1691564400,"i":15,"n_txs":6,"g1":-0.1408,"g2":-0.1633,"g3":0.0349,"uniq_owners":4,"connection":0.9481},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Base x Fini","symbol":"$BASEFINI","address":"0x34e817d631b7fb79a54638c01c03421d124e35a7","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/44cd1c41377491e1c642547aefd991eb.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Three limited edition Finis that respond to your activity on Base, created specially for Onchain Summer 🟡\n\nKurt and his Raybot, Ray, are Basenauts locked in combat with Spike, a notorious commando in the Starlight Extinction Corps. \n\nThe more transactions you make each week on Base, the better Kurt and Ray can defend their fleet against the onslaught of attacks.

Through the combination of diverse references within an algorithm trained on human facial photographs, a series of characters emerged, existing in both historical records and the realms of lore and mythology.\n\nWhile doing research into the cultural representations of Jesus of Nazareth, originating from Byzantine and Renaissance traditions, including iconic works such as Leonardo da Vinci's \"Salvator Mundi\" and the enigmatic Turin Shroud, I adjusted the model to resonate with a Semitic aesthetic, drawing inspiration from the ancient Fayum portraits—among the earliest known lifelike portraits. The stylized elements of Renaissance art, while dominant in the inputs, gracefully yielded to the authenticity of a first-century visage, resonating more credibly with historical context than the artistic conventions of a later era.\n\nThe ensuing creation reverberated globally, engaging audiences from Mexico to Indonesia, as it traversed the pages of scholarly papers and news outlets, heralding a profound realization of AI's transformative potential for visual expression.\n\nFor Bright Moments Venice, I resolved to revive the early Renaissance ethos, imbuing the depiction of Jesus with the ethereal essence of fresco, reminiscent of luminaries such as Botticelli and Bellini. This artistic endeavor not only rekindled echoes of a bygone era but also illuminated the fluidity of AI's \"Latent Space,\" wherein the intricate interplay of cultural influences and biological nuances converges, echoing the intricate tapestry of human existence.\n\nProceeds of the mint go towards the ongoing exhibition of Renascentia at Chiesa di Scuola San Giovanni\n","slug":"renascentia-1","dt":"2024-04-20","ts":1713596400,"i":86,"n_txs":11,"g1":-0.0676,"g2":0.214,"g3":0.01,"uniq_owners":2,"connection":0.5251},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Repetition and Noise","symbol":"REPNOISE","address":"0x8718d8f356fcdcbe6bd359a157a63db898dc3f53","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/80f673b4f355a2a0347fbf3ba4d3fad0.jpg?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Repetition and Noise is about the nature and path of creativity.\n\nIt is a shortlisted work in the Finnish National Gallery's Combine24 generative art competition remixing their CC0 catalog/archive.\nDetails/Vote: https://combine24.alusta.art/\n\nFree open edition, minting through Oct 26th 2024: https://highlight.xyz/mint/base:0x8718d8f356FCDcbe6BD359A157A63dB898dC3f53","slug":"repetition-and-noise","dt":"2024-09-19","ts":1726729200,"i":87,"n_txs":6,"g1":-0.1198,"g2":0.0396,"g3":-0.0539,"uniq_owners":2,"connection":0.5975},{"chainid":"8453","name":"Rez Tabs","symbol":"REZTABS","address":"0x605258084debdc3504c84ca109f0b8c307ec1f98","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/fc1c3a2c3ca04f5e548e4cf0323fa47c.jpg?w=500&auto=format","desc":"Rez Tabs is a collection of 120 AI-generated 10,000-pixel images.

The initial instructions, consistently providing strict constraints, were interpreted in many ways through interactive animations projected on a physical book and triggered by turning the page.\n\n\nCode evolution (and intentional code disruption) gradually diverged from initial instructions, led lines to morph into bands, break their directions, and fracture surfaces into shatters, so the focus of The Anatomy of Fracture became about language imperfections, disruptions of verbal precision, unpredictable visual incidents originating from loose interpretations from spoken language, and embedded ambiguity in the code. Like LeWitt’s instructions, code defines the parameters that orchestrate visual creation, imposing a structure while allowing chance and unpredictability to influence the final output.\n\n\nFrequently combining simple geometries and principles with scientific notations, diagrams, and graphs, I'm suggesting connections, explanations, and additional instructions, but with the aim to augment how pliable and emotional our minds are in perceiving truth and reality. There are conceptual and some visual links to Sol LeWitt’s The Location of Six Geometric Figures (1974), a series of prints typically consisting of a straightforward, diagrammatic drawing accompanied by frustratingly convoluted directions.\n\n~~~~\n\nLook out for the FOMO keyboard key to unlock more variations.\nUse [s] key in live view to save output as PNG. \n\n~~~~\n\nAleksandra Jovanić, 2024","slug":"the-anatomy-of-fracture","dt":"2024-10-08","ts":1728370800,"i":103,"n_txs":2,"g1":-0.028,"g2":0.1025,"g3":0.0229,"uniq_owners":2,"connection":0.5651},{"chainid":"8453","name":"The Anatomy of Sensitivity","symbol":"FXGEN","address":"0x7cbc58cef735d6869157b4b40cb2d26ed46d8537","img":"https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/f94d6bb52f7c44c97a0e94123f640684.png?w=500&auto=format","desc":"“The Anatomy of Sensitivity” is part of the PLACE OF RETURN / XVIII NEW TECHNOLOGIES exhibition at Gallery of Contemporary Art Pančevo (December 25, 2024 – January 20, 2025), curated by Milica Lapčević.\n\n~~~~\n\nThe Anatomy of Sensitivity is the second part of the ongoing \"anatomies\" generative art series. All are loosely based on the same algorithm that gradually diverges from the initial set of instructions. The focus of each part in the series is on revealing analogies between human conditions and code development.\n\nThe first part, The Anatomy of Fracture was about communication-miscommunication, language imperfections, disruptions of verbal precision, unpredictable visual incidents originating from loose interpretations of spoken language, and embedded ambiguity in the code. \n  \nNow, The Anatomy of Sensitivity questions personal sensitivity-insensitivity levels, the ability to perceive and process information from the environment, as well as surprising loss of reaction and overreaction to surroundings and experiences. Are we becoming more or less sensitive? Can sensitivity be controlled? I turned to the processes that allow me to measure, regulate, and identify sensitivity levels. Natural data and unexpected occurrences in experiments with light and materials offer a subtle element of randomness. \n\nFor the code outputs, I’m relying on environmental/meteorological data, mostly sun radiation data, to which humans are objectively sensitive. All shapes are generated according to historical data sourced from open-meteo.com in the period from the beginning of 1940 up to the last day of 2024 for the approximate geolocation of my home city (44.82N 20.45E). \n\nAmong all the data, where the sunshine duration was more than zero, random 3 to 6 rows in sequence are chosen to generate bands. Cloud coverage impacts if the bands are striped or chaotic. The number of stripes in the bends depends on the speed of the wind.  The size of bands is determined by shortwave solar radiation GHI, whereas direct solar radiation specifies the bands' vertical position. The band start position angle is diffuse solar radiation DHI, and the length of the bands is direct normal irradiance DNI.  The remainder of the angles along the bands depends on global tilted radiation GTI, terrestrial solar radiation, shortwave solar radiation GHI (instant), direct solar radiation (instant), diffuse solar radiation DHI (instant), direct normal irradiance DNI (instant), global tilted radiation GTI and terrestrial solar radiation (instant). To achieve visually appealing compositions, all chosen values are normalized before being used.\n\nThe physical component of this work relies on the cyanotype print process, one of the earliest photo-printing techniques that employ a mix of iron compounds, sensitive to the UVA part of the sunlight spectrum. Through the process of developing cyanotypes, a second level of randomness is introduced through varying formula mixes, exposure times, layer distances and angles, placements of masks, etc. \n\nMore about the project:\nhttp://aleksandrajovanic.com/the-anatomy-of-sensitivity/\n\n~~~~\n\nUse [s] key in live view to save output as PNG.\n\n~~~~\n\nAleksandra Jovanić, 2024\n","slug":"the-anatomy-of-sensitivity","dt":"2025-01-20","ts":1737360000,"i":104,"n_txs":5,"g1":-0.028,"g2":0.1025,"g3":0.0229,"uniq_owners":2,"connection":0.5651},{"chainid":"8453","name":"The Button","symbol":"BUTTON","address":"0x5f7577811f2069f6181c7b90b4aec0a34780b48f","img":"https://raw.seadn.io/files/9c0161338de95b1e8dddfa5c77fe8fba.svg","desc":"","slug":"the-button-2","dt":"2024-12-02","ts":1733126400,"i":105,"n_txs":2,"g1":-0.1337,"g2":0.0615,"g3":-0.0407,"uniq_owners":2,"connection":0.6357},{"chainid":"8453","name":"The Infinite Punk Theorem","symbol":"Infinite Punks","address":"0x1d39b08cb7a7ff61fa6b694d5e062c140f621a07","img":"https://raw.seadn.io/files/6478dc2be4044d46ba593f93d7462328.svg","desc":"The [infinite punk theorem](https://infinite.lantonmills.com) states that a smart contract generating random pixel art for an infinite amount of time will surely create any given image, including a CryptoPunk.\n\nFully on-chain 24x24 images.
