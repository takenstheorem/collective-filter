The Congolese Plantation Workers Art League (CATPC) reclaims their heritage and land by using NFT technology as a tool for decolonization.\n\nThe Balot sculpture was carved in 1931, during a Pende uprising against atrocities carried out as part of the Unilever plantation system. Depicting the angry spirit of the Belgian colonial officer Maximilien Balot, it was made to control his spirit and protect the Pende people. Today, the sculpture is held in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond and loan requests by CATPC have thus far been futile.\n\nWith the Balot NFT, CATPC claims back what is theirs: not just art, but land. With each NFT sold, CATPC can buy back one hectare of their depleted land, replant the forest and reintroduce biodiversity.\n\nBuyers get a digital rendering of the Balot sculpture hovering over a fragment of a drawing by CATPC.

A Russian winter is redolent both of great hardship, extreme temperatures, physical privation, an atmosphere of isolation and desolation, but also of great beauty. Photographed in the perpetual twilight of the Kola Peninsula, in the far north-western reaches of Russia, Polyarnye Nochi captures the ethereal meteorological phenomenon affecting this swathe of land that lies between the White Sea and the Barents Sea. Meaning “polar nights”, Polyarnye Nochi represents the naturally occurring period from December to mid-January, when the sun remains below the horizon, allowing for only limited light each day. These photographs explore the uneasy co-existence of man and nature, but also capture the indefinable and elusive beauty that emerges as a result of this precarious alliance.","dt":"2021-12-10","ts":1639123200,"i":189,"n_txs":13,"g1":-0.0042,"g2":-0.0716,"g3":-0.0098,"uniq_owners":11,"connection":0.7379},{"chainid":"1","name":"Poolsuite - Executive Member","symbol":"POOLEXEC","address":"0xb228d7b6e099618ca71bd5522b3a8c3788a8f172","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/p2lvRuQZalsroxpmS-q57pGRzyseAzEkLOGGsR6N6tXh_d4x6osxQtZBKqUMRreepnXJcuR80d-9YRIeMy5XnEsPp8aQQcWOyyPqjg?w=500&auto=format","desc":"","dt":"2021-11-25","ts":1637827200,"i":190,"n_txs":13,"g1":-0.0086,"g2":-0.057,"g3":0.0586,"uniq_owners":8,"connection":0.4743},{"chainid":"1","name":"PORTALS","symbol":"PORTAL","address":"0x0510f2680e132607db2cdec15f9b277043958eaa","img":"https://i.seadn.io/gae/1xCf68FP_GMn9KbC7UfWO23kjUx5Yk_rklKEIklOtWBqCJHLkLIyMNbXa-u08O_FzAAkJXBcyWyjH7Vvui_M0-XISfoC_Ivo_YzyPQ?w=500&auto=format","desc":"PORTALS are shifting into existence;\nCreating spaces where our troubles, minds and our time are non-existent.
